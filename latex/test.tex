We have seen that to typeset something in \LaTeX, we type in thetext to be
typeset together with some \LaTeX\ commands.Words must be separated by spaces
(does not matter how many)and lines maybe broken arbitrarily.The end of a
paragraph is specified by a \emph{blank line}in the input. In other words,
whenever you want to start a newparagraph, just leave a blank line and proceed.
